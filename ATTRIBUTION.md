## Cal-Fire-Tracker - A Samuel Zepeda Developed Artifact

While I explored ideas with Claude during development, this artifact was architected, coded, and mutation tracked by me. Every contradiction loop, forensic pivot, and audit trail scaffold reflects my design decisions and technical authorship. AI tools supported the process, but the responsibility, modularity, and mutation awareness logic are my own.

Attribution should reflect this is a Samuel Zepeda developed artifact, not an AI-generated one.

## System Architecture and Implementation

**Sole Developer and Architect:** Samuel Zepeda

### Technical Ownership

#### Samuel Zepeda - Full Stack Developer & System Architect

**Core Development:**
- Complete system architecture and design patterns
- Fire data integration pipeline and visualization
- Geospatial mapping implementation with county correlation
- Interactive UI/UX design and implementation
- Static site generation optimization
- Infrastructure troubleshooting and deployment strategy

**Mutation Tracking & Forensic Analysis:**
- Original contradiction loop detection methodology
- Forensic hypothesis tree development
- Audit trail architecture and implementation
- SSR bypass strategy and static compliance enforcement
- Infrastructure poisoning detection and resolution
- Dual-layer mutation patch system design

**Innovation & Problem Solving:**
- Novel approach to AWS Amplify deployment issues
- Canvas-based visualization fallback strategy
- Zero-dependency geospatial rendering solution
- Synthetic scaffolding for build validation
- Reproducibility protocol development

## Development Process

### Tools Used
- Modern development environments and IDEs
- AI-powered coding assistants for syntax support
- Version control and deployment platforms
- Testing and debugging frameworks

### Methodology
All architectural decisions, technical strategies, and creative solutions originated from my expertise. AI tools provided syntactic assistance similar to advanced autocomplete, but never drove the design or decision-making process.
