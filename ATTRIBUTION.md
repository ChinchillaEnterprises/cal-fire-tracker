## Technical Contributions

### Core Innovations (Samuel Zepeda)
1. **SSR Detection Bypass Strategy**: Masking Next.js identity through package.json manipulation
2. **Artifact Validity Schema**: Definition of SSR-free compliance patterns
3. **Contradiction Artifact Protocol**: Systematic logging of mutation failures
4. **Forensic Analysis Framework**: Infrastructure drift detection methodology
5. **Vaccine Approach**: Treating SSR contamination as requiring immunization

### Implementation Details (Claude)
1. Python script syntax and structure
2. JSON schema formatting
3. Shell script command sequencing
