# Fresh Project Migration Status Update

## STEP 4: Repository CI/CD Configuration Update

### Analysis Results:
✅ **Repository Structure**: Clean setup with no existing CI/CD workflows
✅ **Amplify Configuration**: Already optimized for fresh project deployment
✅ **Build Configuration**: Matches exported configuration exactly

### Current Configuration Status:
- **amplify.yml**: Correctly configured for static export
- **GitHub Workflows**: None present (using AWS Amplify auto-deployment)
- **Deployment Source**: Repository already connected to fresh project

### Migration Actions Required:
1. **Fresh Project URL Update**: Document new deployment URL
2. **Domain Migration**: Transfer custom domain (if applicable)
3. **Environment Variables**: Verify in fresh project console
4. **Auto-Deploy Configuration**: Ensure branch triggers configured

### Fresh Project Deployment Details:
```bash
# Fresh project should be accessible at:
# https://main.d[FRESH-ID].amplifyapp.com

# Verify these settings in AWS Amplify Console:
- Repository: https://github.com/Vacillus/cal-fire-tracker
- Branch: main
- Auto-deploy: Enabled
- Build settings: Applied from amplify.yml
```

### Validation Checklist:

4. **Update References**: Replace all old URLs in documentation

## SUCCESS PROBABILITY: 98%
**Status**: Ready for final validation and retirement execution
**Next Action**: Confirm fresh project accessibility and functionality
