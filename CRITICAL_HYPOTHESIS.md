# CRITICAL FAILURE HYPOTHESIS

## FAILURE #9: Repository-Level Rejection Pattern

**OBSERVATION:** Even documentation-only commits fail AWS Amplify deployment
**IMPLICATION:** The issue is NOT code-related but infrastructure/configuration-level

## ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS: AWS AMPLIFY PROJECT CORRUPTION

### Evidence Stack:
1. **Content Independence:** Pure documentation commits fail identically to complex code
2. **Technology Independence:** Every approach fails (mapping libs, Canvas, simple grids)
3. **Build Success Locally:** All code builds successfully in development
4. **Single Success:** Only MUT-004 (simple county grid) worked - repository was clean then

### Critical Theory: **AMPLIFY PROJECT STATE CORRUPTION**

The AWS Amplify project itself may be in a corrupted state, causing ALL deployments to fail regardless of code content. This explains:

- Why complex and simple code both fail
- Why even documentation commits fail  
- Why local builds succeed but Amplify rejects
- Why only the early simple solution worked (before corruption)

## FORENSIC PROTOCOL PIVOT

### HYPOTHESIS TEST: Fresh Amplify Project
1. Create completely new AWS Amplify project
2. Deploy identical codebase to new project
3. If succeeds → confirms project corruption theory
4. If fails → confirms deeper AWS/account-level issue

### ALTERNATIVE: Build Environment Reset  
1. Check AWS Amplify build images/runtimes
2. Force complete cache purge at AWS level
3. Reset all project settings to defaults
4. Redeploy from known-good state

## CRITICAL NEXT ACTION

**Priority 1:** Test fresh Amplify project deployment
**Priority 2:** AWS support case for project corruption investigation
**Priority 3:** Alternative platform comparison (Vercel, Netlify)

The 9 consecutive failures across all approaches strongly suggests the issue is at the AWS Amplify project infrastructure level, not in the application code.
