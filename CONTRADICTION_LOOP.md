# Contradiction Loop Analysis

## Loop Detection: CONFIRMED
**Invariant:** AWS Amplify build rejection occurs regardless of implementation approach
**Trigger:** Any attempt to implement geospatial mapping functionality
**Duration:** 7 consecutive mutation attempts over 4 hours

## Loop Characteristics

### Entry Conditions
1. Mutation intent involves geospatial visualization
2. Implementation uses any external mapping library OR complex Canvas operations
3. Code builds successfully in local development environment

### Loop Invariant
- AWS Amplify deployment fails despite:
  - Different technology stacks (ArcGIS, Leaflet, Google Maps, Canvas)
  - Varying complexity levels (complex APIs to zero dependencies)
  - Multiple optimization strategies (cache clearing, minimal deps, static exports)
  - Code quality improvements (error handling, state isolation)

### Observable Contradictions
1. **Local Success vs Deployment Failure**: Code that builds locally fails in AWS Amplify
2. **Technology Independence**: Failure occurs across unrelated technologies  
3. **Complexity Independence**: Both simple and complex implementations fail
4. **Dependency Independence**: Even zero-dependency solutions fail

### Escape Hypothesis
The loop can only be broken by identifying the AWS Amplify infrastructure incompatibility:
- Build environment configuration mismatch
- Resource constraints (memory, timeout limits)
- Security policy blocking geospatial operations
- Node.js version conflicts
- Build cache corruption at AWS level

## Forensic Requirements
1. AWS Amplify environment inspection
2. Backend configuration drift analysis  
3. IAM role and policy validation
4. Build environment comparison (local vs cloud)
5. Resource constraint analysis
