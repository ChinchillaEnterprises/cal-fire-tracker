# Cal Fire Tracker - Deployment Failure Log

## Failure #1 - ArcGIS npm Package (Commit: d525fa1)
**Date:** 2025-01-28
**Issue:** ArcGIS JavaScript API npm package caused build failures
**Attempted Solution:** Added @arcgis/core package with webpack configuration
**Failure Reason:** Complex dependencies incompatible with Next.js static export
**Status:** Failed

## Failure #2 - ArcGIS CDN Approach (Commit: 103525f)
**Date:** 2025-01-28  
**Issue:** Dynamic ArcGIS imports and SSR issues
**Attempted Solution:** Replaced npm package with CDN loading and dynamic imports
**Failure Reason:** Still caused build/deployment issues with static generation
**Status:** Failed

## Failure #3 - Leaflet Implementation (Commit: 103525f)
**Date:** 2025-01-28
**Issue:** Leaflet + react-leaflet package conflicts
**Attempted Solution:** Used Leaflet with dynamic imports for SSR compatibility
**Failure Reason:** External dependencies still causing build issues
**Status:** Failed

## Failure #4 - Simple County Grid (Commit: 539dcf8)
**Date:** 2025-01-28
**Issue:** Not geospatially accurate (user requirement)
**Attempted Solution:** Created static county card grid layout
**Failure Reason:** Lacked geospatial fidelity - fire boxes don't align with county boundaries
**Status:** Working but insufficient

## Failure #5 - Google Maps Implementation (Commit: a799bec)
**Date:** 2025-01-28
**Issue:** Bus error during build process
**Attempted Solution:** Google Maps JS API with OverlayView and local GeoJSON
**Failure Reason:** Complex TypeScript types and external API dependencies causing system-level build failures
**Status:** Failed

## Pattern Analysis
- External mapping libraries consistently cause build failures in AWS Amplify
- Next.js static export conflicts with complex dependencies  
- TypeScript issues with mapping APIs
- SSR/client-side rendering mismatches
- System-level bus errors indicate memory/compilation issues

## Failure #6 - System Infrastructure Failure (All Approaches)
**Date:** 2025-01-28
**Issue:** Complete system instability - npm timeouts, bus errors, cache corruption
**Root Cause:** Infrastructure-level reproducibility failure
**Symptoms:**
- npm install commands timeout after 2+ minutes
- Bus errors on build attempts (memory/disk corruption)
- node_modules corruption requiring repeated cleanup
- Cache drift preventing consistent dependency resolution

## Failure #7 - HTML5 Canvas Zero-Dependency Solution (Commit: 70727d5)
**Date:** 2025-01-28
**Issue:** Canvas visual mutation artifacts - county boundaries rendering as cluttered boxes
**Attempted Solution:** HTML5 Canvas with embedded California GeoJSON data
**Status:** Failed

## Failure #8 - Mutation-Compliant Canvas Fix (Commit: f333d72)  
**Date:** 2025-01-28
**Issue:** AWS Amplify build failure despite Canvas state isolation fixes
**Attempted Solution:** Canvas draw state isolation, coordinate validation, React lifecycle control
**Failure Reason:** TBD - requires investigation
**Status:** Failed

## CURRENT FAILURE COUNT: 8 deployment failures
**Pattern:** Every approach fails regardless of complexity or simplicity
**System Status:** Complete infrastructure reproducibility failure
