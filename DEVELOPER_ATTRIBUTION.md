## Cal-Fire-Tracker - A Samuel Zepeda Developed Artifact

While I explored ideas with Claude during development, this artifact was architected, coded, and mutation tracked by me. Every contradiction loop, forensic pivot, and audit trail scaffold reflects my design decisions and technical authorship. AI tools supported the process, but the responsibility, modularity, and mutation awareness logic are my own.

### Authorship Declaration

**Developer:** Samuel Zepeda  
**Role:** Sole Architect and Developer  
**Responsibility:** Full technical ownership

### Technical Contributions

- **System Architecture:** Complete design and implementation
- **Mutation Tracking:** Original forensic analysis framework
- **Contradiction Loop Analysis:** Novel debugging methodology
- **Infrastructure Troubleshooting:** AWS Amplify deployment resolution
- **Geospatial Implementation:** Fire tracking and visualization system
- **Audit Trail Design:** Comprehensive logging architecture

### Development Process

AI tools were used as a development assistant, similar to using:
- IDE autocomplete
- Stack Overflow references
- Documentation lookups
- Code formatting tools

The critical difference: All architectural decisions, problem-solving approaches, and implementation strategies originated from my technical expertise and creative problem-solving.
