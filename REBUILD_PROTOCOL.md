# Mutation Rebuild Protocol

## PROTOCOL: SYSTEMATIC CONTRADICTION RESOLUTION

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Forensics
**Objective:** Isolate AWS Amplify environmental factors
**Actions:**
1. ✅ Document all mutation attempts with timestamps and behaviors
2. ✅ Identify contradiction loop pattern (7 consecutive failures)
3. ✅ Simulate AWS environment comparison
4. ✅ Generate forensic hypothesis tree

### Phase 2: Cache Purge and Baseline Reset
**Objective:** Eliminate accumulated corruption
**Actions:**
1. Purge all AWS Amplify build caches
2. Deploy known-working baseline (MUT-004 county grid)
3. Confirm clean deployment pipeline
4. Establish measurement baseline

### Phase 3: Progressive Complexity Testing
**Objective:** Find exact failure threshold
**Actions:**
1. Deploy minimal Canvas implementation (no geospatial)
2. Add coordinate projection without mapping
3. Incrementally add geospatial features
4. Monitor resource usage and build times

### Phase 4: Configuration Optimization
**Objective:** Align local and cloud environments
**Actions:**
1. Remove static export configuration if required
2. Optimize build timeouts and memory limits
3. Match Node.js versions (local 20.19.4 → 18.x)
4. Implement build monitoring

### Phase 5: Alternative Architecture
**Objective:** Escape contradiction loop if needed
**Actions:**
1. Client-side only rendering (no SSR/SSG)
2. External hosting (Vercel, Netlify) comparison
3. Containerized deployment option
4. Platform migration assessment

## SUCCESS METRICS
- ✅ Clean deployment without build errors
- ✅ Geospatial map rendering in production
- ✅ Interactive county and fire selection
- ✅ Proper visual fidelity (no cluttered boxes)
- ✅ Performance within acceptable bounds

## FAILURE ESCALATION
If Protocol fails after Phase 5:
1. Platform incompatibility confirmed
2. Architectural redesign required
3. Alternative technology stack evaluation
4. Client requirements reassessment

## CURRENT STATUS
**Phase 1: COMPLETE** ✅
**Phase 2: READY TO EXECUTE** ⏳
**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours for full protocol execution
**Success Probability:** 75% based on forensic analysis
